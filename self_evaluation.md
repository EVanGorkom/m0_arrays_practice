How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
 - I feel fairly confident with the basic methods that we learned today. I'm sure I will feel increasingly less so as we learn more and more, but at the moment I'm feeling pretty comfortable.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
 - The only additional learning I need at the moment is to study up on the what each method does exactly. Maybe i'll make some flash cards.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
 - I'm curious how you would go about editing a single piece of a variable inside of an array. I imagine there's a rather simple way to do it and I just don't know yet, but that is my only question thus far.
